# Book Library App

A modern and responsive book management app built with React. This project was developed as the final assignment for the Frontend Development course (FFU1200) and showcases key frontend principles including component-based architecture, API integration, CRUD operations with Firebase, and modular CSS styling using BEM methodology.

## Features

- Login system using localStorage (admin/1234)

- View book list stored in Firebase Firestore

- Add books manually via a form with validation

- Search for books from the Open Library API

- Delete books from Firestore

- Responsive design using custom media queries

- Component styling using CSS and BEM naming convention

- Fallback image if book image is missing

- Navigation bar dynamically adjusts links based on login status


## Technologies Used

React (Vite) – SPA structure with functional components

React Router DOM – page routing

Firebase Firestore – database for persistent storage

Open Library API – book search integration

CSS (vanilla) – scoped styling with BEM and variables

localStorage – login session persistence
